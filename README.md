# ML Learning Atlas

A comprehensive collection of learning pathways mapping the machine learning landscape for different roles and backgrounds. Like a detailed atlas, this repository guides you through various territories of ML, helping you chart the most effective route to your learning destination.

## üéØ Project Goals

This repository aims to:
- Provide structured learning paths tailored to different roles and backgrounds
- Offer flexibility in learning by modularizing content
- Enable learners to choose paths based on their goals and existing knowledge
- Bridge the gap between theory and practical applications

## üõ†Ô∏è Learning Paths

Each learning path is carefully curated for specific roles:
- **[SDE to AI](learning-paths/sde-to-ai.md)**: Helps software engineers leverage their programming background to transition into AI development
- **[ML Engineer](learning-paths/ai-developer.md)**: Focuses on building and deploying ML systems at scale
- **[Product Manager](learning-paths/product-manager.md)**: Emphasizes AI product development, evaluation, and lifecycle management
- **[Data Scientist](learning-paths/data-scientist.md)**: Concentrates on data analysis, model development, and statistical inference
- **[Linear Algebra to LLM](learning-paths/linear-algebra-to-llm.md)**: Provides a mathematical foundation journey from basic linear algebra to understanding and building large language models
- **[AWS Certification for AI/ML](learning-paths/aws-certification-ml.md)**: Guides professionals through AWS certifications and services specifically tailored for machine learning deployment and operations in the cloud


## üìö Module Categories

Our modules cover a wide range of topics, organized into major categories. For detailed descriptions, prerequisites, and learning objectives of each module, please refer to our [modules guide](modules/modules.md).

### Foundations
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, calculus, probability & statistics

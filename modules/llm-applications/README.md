# LLM Applications

## Introduction
Learn how to work with Large Language Models (LLMs), understand their capabilities, and build practical applications using state-of-the-art language models.

## Learning Path

### 1. LLM Fundamentals
- Understanding transformer architecture
- Types of language models
- Tokenization and embeddings
- Fine-tuning vs. prompting

### 2. Working with LLMs
- API integration
- Prompt engineering
- Context window management
- Output parsing

### 3. Application Development
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Text generation and summarization
- Question answering systems
- Content creation tools

### 4. Advanced Topics
- Few-shot learning
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Ethical considerations and bias
